# 🧠 Data Science Journey 🚀  
Welcome to my **Data Science Learning Repository** — a collection of my notes, experiments, and projects as I dive deep into the world of Data Science and Machine Learning.  

Each folder in this repo represents a key milestone — from understanding data to building real-world AI models.

## 🧩 Repository Structure  

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| 📂 `datacollecting` | Techniques for collecting and cleaning data from different sources (APIs, web scraping, CSVs). |
| 📂 `numpy` | My hands-on practice with NumPy — arrays, broadcasting, indexing, and linear algebra operations. |
| 📂 `pandas` | Data manipulation, cleaning, merging, and analysis using Pandas. |
| 📂 `matplotlib` | Data visualization basics — plotting, styling, and customizing charts. |
| 📂 `seaborn` | Advanced visualizations and statistical plots for deeper EDA. |
| 📂 `probabilityfords` | Probability, statistics, and math concepts for understanding ML fundamentals. |
| 📂 `sk-learn` | Machine learning models: regression, classification, clustering, pipelines, and evaluation. |
| 📂 `deep learning` | Experiments with neural networks, TensorFlow/Keras, and model optimization. |
